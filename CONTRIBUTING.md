# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Code of Conduct

This project is released with
a [Contributor Code of Conduct](docs/code-of-conduct.md). By
participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already
submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably
don't need to do it again. When you submit pull requests, a helpful
Google CLA bot will tell you if you need to sign the CLA.

## Code changes

Before you make significant code changes, please open an issue to
discuss your plans. This will minimize the amount of review required
for pull requests.

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this
purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for more information on using pull requests.
